# Android Tutorials

This is a set of Android Tutorials that i made using Android Studio and Java. 

To build and start the projects, open them **seperately** in Android studio

I will now go through each project and describe what i learned

### Basic

This is a project that holds a collection of small apps. The first thing i learned was how to cange the icon of the app, then i went on to the smaller apps inside of it:

- For the Splash Screen I learned how to put an Image in for the splash screen and how to put in a sound for the intro. 

- The main screen is a set of buttons that lead to the other apps in the project I added a mouse click sound when i pressed one of the buttons. I added another text view below the buttons so that i could show a scroll view working. These parts could be the start of a main screen in any app.

- The first app in this project deals with changing the text style and gravity. This could be used in almost all apps to enhance the style of the app.

- The second app is a list view of links to all the other apps in this project, this is an easy way to make a simple set of links if design quality is not needed.
 
- Next is an app that changes the wallpaper of your device, this could be done with any image but it is just with solid colors right now. I use a toast message to tell the user that the wallpaper has been changed.

- I drew images to the screen first a ball moving in a fixed direction, then a ball moving with the users touch also a sprite walking around the edge of the screen. All of these things can be used when making mobile games.

- The last app in this project was playing a pre loaded video. This can be used in all apps as videos can brighten up simple text apps.

I learned a lot doing this project to make basic apps.


### Intermediate

This is a follow on from the basic project that is described above, and it is simelar in the way that it is made up of smaller apps:

- The first app in this project is one that passes data between two pages, this sets the first 2 buttons, then the third button multiplies their values. Logic actions like this and passing data between pages are essential for the workings of any good app.

- The second app is one that saves the settings in the preferences of a page so if you close it , the preferences are loaded back in. This app also shows the use of a checkbox for boolean operations. These are more essentials of good android apps, being able to save your settings and boolean operations can be used for almost anything.

- Next was saving a journal entry to the app and reading it back in the next app. This is done with fileInputStreams and fileOutputStreams and can be used for any number of saving and loading operations your app can need.

- Last I learned how to save files from the app into the devices memory. This is another very useful feature to have in any app as you can back up the data from the app, save screenshots of the app or a lot of other operations that you may need.

This project thought me a lot more about making aps and I think that it will help me make my own apps in the future.


**api:** http://localhost:8080/api/getRandomBeer

**home page:**  http://localhost:8080/index.html


## How I could make this app better in the future

- Add a MySQL database to replace the in memory HSQL database. 

- Attempted to add image of each beer bottle to the front end, continuing to work on this.

- Add more to the database as it is very small now. 

- Add to the API with more features, eg. getbeerbyname
